        "# Key Concepts of RESTful API:\n",
        "1. Resources:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Everything in REST is considered a resource (e.g., a user, an order, a product).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Each resource is identified by a URL (e.g., https://api.example.com/users/123).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. HTTP Methods:\n",
        "* REST uses standard HTTP methods to perform actions on resources:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. GET – Retrieve data\n",
        "\n",
        "2. POST – Create a new resource\n",
        "\n",
        "3. PUT – Update an existing resource (full update)\n",
        "\n",
        "4. PATCH – Update part of a resource (partial update)\n",
        "\n",
        "5. DELETE – Remove a resource\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Stateless:\n",

        "* Each API request is independent. The server doesn’t store client context between requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "* All necessary information must be sent in the request.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. JSON or XML:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Most RESTful APIs use JSON to format data, though XML is sometimes supported.\n",
